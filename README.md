‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites and Installation
To run this project, you will need the following:

1. Software Dependencies
Node.js: Version 18.17 or higher.

Git: For version control.

An active FTP Server: You need an FTP server to connect to. For local development and testing, we have used FileZilla Server.

Download FileZilla Server: You can download this free software from its official website and install it on Windows.

Setup: After installation, create a user with a password and assign a folder from your computer as its home directory. Grant the necessary permissions (read, write, delete) to the user.

2. Project Setup Steps
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ftp-file-manager.git
cd ftp-file-manager

Install dependencies:

npm install

Create the environment variables file:
Create a file named .env.local in the root of your project and enter your FTP server details.

# .env.local

# Your FTP Server credentials
# For local testing with FileZilla Server:
FTP_HOST="127.0.0.1"
FTP_USER="your_ftp_user"      # The username you created in FileZilla Server
FTP_PASSWORD="your_ftp_password" # The password you set

Run the development server:

npm run dev

Your project is now available at http://localhost:3000.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Note
In the lib/ftp-client.ts file, the rejectUnauthorized: false option is used to connect to a local FTP server (which does not have a valid SSL certificate).

Never use this option in a production environment to connect to a real server on the internet, as it compromises the security of your connection.
